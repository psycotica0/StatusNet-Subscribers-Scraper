This was written because identi.ca/bugabundo wanted all his subscribers and FOAF was broken.

It is invoked like this: ./subs.sh identi.ca/bugabundo
It then spits out the profile urls of all subscribers.

It's very fragile and likely to break, but it works for now.

It also requires my Scrape utility, which as of this writing can be found at http://github.com/psycotica0/Scrape
